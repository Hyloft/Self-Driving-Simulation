# Self-Driving Car Simulation for Teknofest Robotaxi Competition

## Overview

This repository contains the Python code and simulation for a self-driving car designed for the Teknofest Robotaxi competition. The project includes features such as lane keeping, obstacle avoidance, autonomous parking, pathfinding with navigation algorithms, and traffic sign detection with dynamic path replanning.

## Features

- **Lane Keeping**: Ensures the car stays within the lane boundaries.

- **Autonomous Parking**: Parks the car autonomously in designated areas.


- **Pathfinding**: Uses navigation algorithms to find the optimal path.

- **Traffic Sign Detection**: Detects traffic signs and replans the path accordingly.
